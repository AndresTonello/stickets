# Stickets - https://andreuscafe.github.io/stickets/
Stickets (Super-tickets!) app, a very simple n' cool app to help you keep your ideas ordered.

That's at least how I do use it.

## Setup

This app uses VueJS and SASS. Since VueJS is added to the project via script tag, all you have to do is follow the next commands.

Make sure you have **npm** installed:

```shell
> git clone git@github.com:andreuscafe/stickets.git
>Â cd stickets/
> npm install
> npm run start
```

All the code is inside js/index.js. I'm not using vue components (therefore, there's no need to use webpack) since this project started being pretty simple and I didn't think it would grow this much, though it still being a pretty small app and maybe it's worth using components now.
